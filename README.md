## Description

Implementation of the sequence-to-point CNN methodology for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring as part of a research internship at Powerchainger Groningen.

The seq2point model has been trained and tested on different sampling frequencies of two datasets, namely REDD and UK-DALE. 
Cross-domain testing between the two datasets with an optional fine-tuning step is also available.
